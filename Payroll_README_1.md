## 📌 Overview

A console-based employee payroll management system demonstrating advanced Java OOP concepts including abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism, ArrayList, and File I/O.

---

## 🚀 Features

- View pay stubs for all employees
- Payroll summary report (total gross, tax, net pay)
- Look up individual employee by ID
- Save payroll report to text file (File I/O)
- Supports 3 employee types with different pay calculations

---

## 👥 Employee Types

| Type | Pay Calculation | Tax Rate |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Full-Time (Salaried) | Annual salary ÷ 12 | 25% |
| Part-Time (Hourly) | Hours × rate (1.5x overtime) | 25% |
| Contractor | Fixed contract amount | 30% |

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Abstract class | `Employee` base class |
| Inheritance | `FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`, `Contractor` |
| Polymorphism | Each type overrides `calculateGrossPay()` |
| Encapsulation | Private fields with public getters |
| ArrayList | Employee list management |
| File I/O | `PrintWriter` saves report to file |
| Method overriding | `calculateTax()` overridden in Contractor |
